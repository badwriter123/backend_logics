# Hello
### These are the backend logic files, which can be reused...
1. requests.js --> This file is used to get requests from any website on the web using the node http module. Replace the URL with your desired URL for data extraction.
2. axios/req.js --> This file is the same implementation of the requests.js file , but using the axios module. Axios is a promise-based JS module for HTTP requests. The file captures requests and catches any errors, Which is better than the requests.js file.
3. planets-project --> this folder has a file index.js that uses the kepler_data.csv file to extract data using fs stream and gives a list containing names of the most habitable planets near to our earth. The habitability category is based upon three categories, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_object_of_interest">koi_desposition</a> , <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_object_of_interest">koi_insol</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_object_of_interest">koi_radius</a>.
