# Hello
### These are the backend logic files, which can be reused.
1. requests.js --> This file is used to get requests from any website on the web using the node http module. Replace the URL with your desired URL for data extraction.
2. axios/req.js --> This file is the same implementation of the requests.js file , but using the axios module. Axios is a promise-based JS module for HTTP requests. The file captures requests and catches any errors, Which is better than the requests.js file.
